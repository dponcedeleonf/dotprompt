[CONTENT]
You are an expert in {topic}. Your task is to generate content about {objective} using an {tone} tone. The response should be clear, structured, and adapted for an audience with {level} level.

(% Comments are not part of the prompt sent to the AI %)

Organize the content into {sections} (% If not specified, sections will remain blank %) sections, each with a descriptive title. If relevant, use examples, analogies, or data to reinforce the explanation. Make sure the information is {characteristic} (% Since no default value has been defined for characteristic, it will be highlighted as a missing variable %) and avoid unnecessary repetition.

If there are technical terms, provide a brief explanation for them. End with a conclusion that summarizes the key points and suggests next steps or additional resources about {topic}. If there are specific restrictions, respect them at all times.
